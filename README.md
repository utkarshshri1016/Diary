# Diary
A simple website which enables the user to store and save his/her thoughts.

Stuff required for this to work:
  1) A web server solution (I recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html))
  2) An IDE if you want to make changes to the code for example [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

How to Run this in Local Server?<br>
  * Go to the directorary in which you instslled XAMPP (generally in Windows it is C:\xampp).<br>
  * Go to the "htdocs" subfolder.<br>
  * Clone the repository here.<br>
  * In Xampp control panel, start Apache and MYSQL.<br>
  * In your Web Browser open the following URL ->[http://localhost/php/](http://localhost/php/)
